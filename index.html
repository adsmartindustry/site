						I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. *Insistently* Bow ties are cool! Come on Amy, I'm a
						normal bloke, tell me what normal blokes do! Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush. It's a fez. I
						wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern
						Society Awful?'! You've swallowed a planet! You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going
						to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? Aw, you're all Mr.
						Grumpy Face today. Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush.

						You've swallowed a planet! I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And
						that is not how I'm introducing myself. No… It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more
						greatness. Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. No… It's a

						fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't
						know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. No, I'll fix it. I'm good at fixing
						rot. Call me the Rotmeister. No, I'm the Doctor. Don't call me the Rotmeister. It's art! A

						it. Not now, not ever, do you understand me?! I'm the Doctor, the Oncoming Storm - and you
						basically meant beat them in a football match, didn't you? You hit me with a cricket bat. You've
						swallowed a planet! Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be
						there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship.

						I find your lack of faith disturbing. Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any
						mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want

						Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. Partially, but it also obeys your commands.
						Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or
						wherever you're going. Ye-ha! In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. I need your
						help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. Your eyes can
						deceive you. Don't trust them. I'm trying not to, kid. Look, I ain't in this for your
						revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the
						money. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid.
						The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no
						weapons. You can't possibly… The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. I'm surprised
						you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself. Look, I can take you as far as
						Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. Your eyes can
						deceive you. Don't trust them. As you wish. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more
						star systems will slip through your fingers. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the
						responsibility yourself. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. I care. So, what do you think of her,
						Han?
